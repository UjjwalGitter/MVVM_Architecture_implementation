# Mvvm
The Model-View-ViewModel Pattern
The main players in the MVVM pattern are:
1. The View — that informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions
2. The ViewModel — exposes streams of data relevant to the View
3. The DataModel — abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
